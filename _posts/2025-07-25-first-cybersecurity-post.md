# Welcome to the Cybersecurity side of my blog

This is where I will post the progress for my portfolio projects as well as document my progress in the field of Cybersecurity.

# What I accomplished today

Today I successfully set up my blog. I chose to use the Chirpy theme because of its feature-rich capabilities as well as the fact that its a good theme to use for a long term blog. 
The other thing that I accomplished today is creating my second bootable Ubuntu usb, this time with a persistent partition. For this usb I decided that I wanted to make something 
that could grow with me so I did some research and eventually ended up deciding that the correct usb for me would be the Kingston DataTraveler Max Type-a 256gb usb stick due to its 
size and speed. The main problem that I had was that the program I used for the last bootable USB, Rufus, was unable to partition nearly the ammount of space that I wanted to since 
this USB has so much space. What I ended up doing was using my old bootable USB launching Ubuntu on there and temporarily, since there was no persistent storage on the USB,
installing both a new Ubuntu iso file and mkusb to setup the new one for a larger partition. This took forever because the old one was a really crappy USB from walmart but after
getting it set up I have now installed a couple of tools including nmap, tmux, htop, and neofecth among a few others.
